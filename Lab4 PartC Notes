Part C: Preemptive Multitasking and Inter-Process communication (IPC)
Exercise 13
While an NMI handler is executing, the processor ignores further interrupt signals at the NMI pin until the next IRET instruction is executed.

The IF (interrupt-enable flag) controls the acceptance of external interrupts signalled via the INTR pin. 
When IF=0, INTR interrupts are inhibited; when IF=1, INTR interrupts are enabled. As with the other flag bits, 
the processor clears IF in response to a RESET signal. The instructions CLI and STI alter the setting of IF.

CLI (Clear Interrupt-Enable Flag) and STI (Set Interrupt-Enable Flag) explicitly alter IF (bit 9 in the flag register). 
These instructions may be executed only if CPL <= IOPL. A protection exception occurs if they are executed when CPL > IOPL.
